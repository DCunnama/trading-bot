# Trading Bot (Codex-assisted)

A skeletal Python bot that will evolve with the help of OpenAI Codex.  
## Quick start
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set environment variables such as API keys before running:

```bash
export EXCHANGE_API_KEY=your_exchange_key
export EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY=your_exchange_secret
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# Or place them in a .env file
```

Finally, run the placeholder bot:

```bash
python main.py
```

```
